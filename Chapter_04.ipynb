    "The `ReflectiveTravelAgentWithSelfExplanation` class simulates a travel agent that not only recommends destinations based on user preferences but also explains the reasoning behind its recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preference-Based Recommendations**: It takes user preferences (like budget, luxury, and adventure preferences) and calculates scores for different travel destinations by weighing those preferences. The destination with the highest score is recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Explanation**: For each recommendation, the agent generates a detailed self-explanation. This explanation outlines the factors that led to the recommendation, such as proximity to popular attractions, budget-friendly options, or the presence of adventure activities. The purpose is to provide transparency into how the decision was made, helping the user understand the reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback Reflection**: The agent doesn't stop after making the recommendation. It actively reflects on user feedback (whether positive or negative). If the feedback is negative, it introspects on its decision-making process and adjusts the importance (weights) it assigns to user preferences for future recommendations. For instance, if a user dislikes a budget-friendly recommendation, the agent might reduce the emphasis it places on budget-related preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Engagement**: The class also simulates a dialogue with the user. After giving the recommendation and the self-explanation, it collects feedback from the user, allowing for a more collaborative interaction. This feedback is then used to refine future recommendations, making the agent more adaptive and personalized.\n",

    "The `ReflectiveTravelAgentWithSelfModeling` class represents a sophisticated travel recommendation system that utilizes **self-modeling** to enhance its decision-making and adaptability. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - **Self-Model and Knowledge Base:** The agent starts with an internal model that includes its goals and a knowledge base. \n",
    "     - **Goals:** Initially, the goals are set to provide personalized recommendations, optimize user satisfaction, and not prioritize eco-friendly options by default.\n",
    "     - **Knowledge Base:** It contains information about various travel destinations, including their ratings, costs, luxury levels, and sustainability. This base also tracks user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Updating Goals:**\n",
    "   - **Adapting to Preferences:** When new user preferences are provided, the agent can update its goals accordingly. For example, if the user prefers eco-friendly options, the agent will adjust its goals to prioritize recommending sustainable travel options. Similarly, if the userâ€™s budget changes, the agent will refocus on cost-effective recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Updating Knowledge Base:**\n",
    "   - **Incorporating Feedback:** After receiving feedback from users, the agent updates its knowledge base. If the feedback is positive, the agent increases the rating of the recommended destination. If the feedback is negative, the rating is decreased. This helps the agent refine its recommendations based on real user experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Making Recommendations:**\n",
    "   - **Calculating Scores:** The agent evaluates each destination by calculating a score based on its rating and, if eco-friendly options are a goal, it adjusts the score by adding the sustainability rating.\n",
    "   - **Selecting the Best Destination:** The destination with the highest score is recommended to the user. This process ensures that the recommendation aligns with both user preferences and the agentâ€™s goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Engaging with the User:**\n",
    "   - **Providing Recommendations:** The agent presents the recommended destination to the user and asks for feedback.\n",
    "   - **Feedback Handling:** The feedback (positive or negative) is used to update the knowledge base, which helps improve future recommendations. \n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_preferences = {\n",
    "       \"budget\": 0.6,            # Moderate budget constraint\n",

    "   - **Outcome:** These preferences indicate that the user has a moderate budget, moderate luxury preferences, a high interest in adventure, and a strong preference for eco-friendly options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Getting a Recommendation:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   recommendation = agent.recommend_destination(user_preferences)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Requests a travel destination recommendation from the agent based on the provided user preferences.\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Updates the agentâ€™s knowledge base with the feedback received from the user.\n",

It initializes the agent, sets user preferences, obtains a recommendation, engages the user for feedback, and updates the agentâ€™s knowledge base based on that feedback. This simulation helps illustrate the agentâ€™s self-modeling capabilities and its ability to adapt and improve recommendations over time."
