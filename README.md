## Running the Notebooks

You can run the notebooks in this repository in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab

Each notebook can be opened directly in Google Colab by clicking on the "Open in Google Colab" badge in the notebook's header:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/username/repository-name/blob/main/notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb)

This is the quickest way to get started as it requires no local setup.

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Server

To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Navigate to the `notebooks` directory** in the Jupyter interface and select the notebook you want to run.

Note: Some notebooks may require additional dependencies or environment variables. Check the notebook header for specific requirements.
