      "3. **Activities and Itinerary Design:** \n",
      "   - Task for the Activities and Excursions Planner: Create a moderate-paced itinerary with iconic Paris sightseeing and cultural experiences. Include activities like spa visits or a Seine River cruise, and propose at least one gourmet dining at a renowned restaurant with a view to complement the anniversary occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transportation and Mobility Planning:** \n",

      "1. **Departure Time:** The Delta Airlines flight has an afternoon departure at 5:30 PM, which aligns with the preference for afternoon departures. Although it is slightly into the evening, it is the closest match among the listed options.\n",

      "3. **Price and Budget:** At $780, this flight option is the least expensive among the choices, which helps conserve more of the $8,000 budget for other aspects of the trip such as accommodation and activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Flight Duration:** With a flight duration of 7 hours and 45 minutes, it provides a relatively fast route to Paris.\n",

      "5. **Airline Reliability:** Delta Airlines is recognized for its reliability and quality of service, ensuring flexibility and peace of mind during travel.\n",
