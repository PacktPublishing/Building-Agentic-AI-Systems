      "   - **Day Trip**: From Kyoto, take a day trip to Nara, known for its historical significance and the friendly deer that roam freely.\n",
      "   - **Sites**: Visit Todai-ji Temple with its Great Buddha, and Kasuga-taisha, a Shinto shrine with hundreds of lanterns.\n",

      "   - **Stay**: Enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere here, famous for its beautifully preserved Edo-era districts and samurai residences.\n",

      "3. **Flights**: Depending on your departure location and destination, round-trip flights can range from $200 to $1,000+. Booking in advance or during sales can help reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Food and Dining**: \n",
      "   - Street food or casual dining can be as low as $5-15 per meal.\n",
      "   - Mid-range restaurants might charge $20-50 per meal.\n",
      "   - Fine dining could be $75+ per meal.\n",

      "5. **Activities**: Beach activities like snorkeling, surfing lessons, or boat tours can range from $20-100 per activity.\n",

      "6. **Transportation**: Consider local transportation like buses, taxis, or rentals. Costs can vary based on the region.\n",

    "\n",
    "Episodic memory preserves successful interactions as learning examples that guide future behavior. Unlike short-term memory which stores facts, episodic memory captures the full context of an interaction—the situation, the thought process that led to success, and why that approach worked. These memories help the agent learn from experience, adapting its responses based on what has worked before. In the following example, we create a travel agent system with episodic memory using the `langmem` library. The code defines a `TravelEpisode` schema that captures four critical elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the customer's travel request \n",
    "- the agent's planning considerations\n",
    "- the specific recommendation provided, and \n",
    "- the positive outcome that resulted. \n",
    " \n",
    "When the system processes a conversation where a traveler expresses concerns about Italian crowds, it stores how the agent successfully redirected them to less-crowded alternatives while still satisfying their desire for art and cuisine. This structured approach to remembering successful interactions allows the system to develop a repository of effective strategies that can be applied to similar situations in the future."
