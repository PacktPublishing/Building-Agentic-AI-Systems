    "\n",
    "The `ReflectiveTravelAgentWithSelfExplanation` class simulates a travel agent that not only recommends destinations based on user preferences but also explains the reasoning behind its recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preference-Based Recommendations**: It takes user preferences (like budget, luxury, and adventure preferences) and calculates scores for different travel destinations by weighing those preferences. The destination with the highest score is recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Explanation**: For each recommendation, the agent generates a detailed self-explanation. This explanation outlines the factors that led to the recommendation, such as proximity to popular attractions, budget-friendly options, or the presence of adventure activities. The purpose is to provide transparency into how the decision was made, helping the user understand the reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback Reflection**: The agent doesn't stop after making the recommendation. It actively reflects on user feedback (whether positive or negative). If the feedback is negative, it introspects on its decision-making process and adjusts the importance (weights) it assigns to user preferences for future recommendations. For instance, if a user dislikes a budget-friendly recommendation, the agent might reduce the emphasis it places on budget-related preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Engagement**: The class also simulates a dialogue with the user. After giving the recommendation and the self-explanation, it collects feedback from the user, allowing for a more collaborative interaction. This feedback is then used to refine future recommendations, making the agent more adaptive and personalized.\n",
